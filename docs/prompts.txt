YouTubePlaylistScrapper
- I love youtube. I love its recommendation system. But. I am tormented by YouTubes incessent copyright strikes, them handling it by removing all the video metadata. And, when I have that song in your playlist, the only thing which you are left with is 'Unavailable video'. Think about it, you lost the song which you so dearly enjoyed. My project will simply ensure that you never face that, you always have the song names saved safely in an offline xlsx format. You 1 YouTube 0.

GoogleApartmentReviewScrapper
