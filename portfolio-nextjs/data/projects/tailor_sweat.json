        "Fortunately, had the opportunity to work on this as academic/personal with major contributions from Nelson Joseph(nelson123-lab) and Nikhil Das Karavatt(NDK22), and last but surely not the least, courtesy Dr. Alex Dillhoff for giving us the opportunity",

        "The application would ingest user data from his/her profile, workout history, preferences, etc. Calculate insights based on preset rules, give more weightage to some aspects, etc. and then use the neural net to come up with predictions. The model was retrained with a 14 day frequency",
