        "I use <strong>free music</strong>, I believe in free music. I also believe I shouldn't need to remember all the names of the songs in my youtube playlists",
        "When a <strong>copyright</strong> strike happens on any song in the playlist, its removed and shows up as video unavailable on the playlist",
        "To mitigate this horrendous behavior(thanks YouTube), I came up with an idea where I would just take periodic backups of all my(public) playlists, and store them in <strong>xlsx</strong> format",
        "Wrote the project in Java, performed <strong>multithreaded http requests</strong> to get playlist data, did regex matching on songs, and stored the data in xlsx format",
        "<strong>Dockerised</strong> the project, pushed to <strong>dockerHub(registry)</strong>, used github actions for <strong>CICD</strong>",
        "Best part was I <strong>anacroned</strong> the project to run daily without missing. Anacron doesn't run like cron(dosent have a deamon running), so <strong>cron + anacron</strong> was it",
        "Further extension can use <strong>youtube playlist api</strong> for a cleaner scalable approach, intelligence engine based on the xlsx data dump"
